# About this strategy

There are multiple actions a unit can follow in order to increase its win rate:

- Look for a weapon (when there is no one equipped)
- Look for a health pack (to take, or stay there & to have it with anticipation)
- Dodge a bullet (jumping a little, jumping a lot, not moving at all, or running to hide behind a wall)
- Look for a better weapon (because of the type itself or to avoid reloading the current one)
- Look for the enemy (it does not help, unless the enemy is not moving at all, just to ensure winning the game)

Questions that come to my mind:
1- How important are these actions?
2- Can the unit has more than 1 purpose at the same time?

## Let's define the main purposes

I believe *the most important thing is to find a weapon*. 
This way the unit can shoot even while moving and having other purposes.

The 2nd purpose would be looking for a health pack.
But, to take in consideration:

- Some levels do not have health packs at all
- The enemy could be located nearest to the health pack
- A rocket can cause more damage than the healing amount, or even finish with the unit's life

## Secondary purposes

A unit while fighting does not want primarily:
- to dodge bullets 
- to look for better weapons, or
- to reload with anticipation

Those are actions that are taken according to circumstances:
- While moving to 1 direction, dodge the possible offensive bullets
- While running out of ammo & passing very near to a new weapon, take it
- Reload the weapon if the enemy is far away or there are walls in the middle

At this moment, the unit has 2 main purposes, that can be affected totally or partially by a secondary purpose.

It means that a unit could prefer to be impacted by a bullet to quickly change the weapon and avoid reloading, because it takes several seconds.
But, if this is a rocket bullet, probably it's better to dodge & come back afterwards.

Also, I said partially, because the unit can dodge bullets while moving to 1 direction.

## Advanced decisions

I don't think will have the enough time to improve the strategy and so compete with the top ones.

But just in that case, I'm aware that there are even more possible combinations, like:

- Pay attention where the enemy is moving to, to decide what main purpose is preferable, 
estimating the time that a jump or a move to a X position will take

- Move not to the nearest convenient positions, but to the more secure actions  

## TODO List

Let's start with simplified ideas to advance in the ranking.

* [ ] Dodge rocket launcher bullets
* [ ] Take in consideration the explosion area of rockets
* [ ] If there is a better weapon near, just take it
* [ ] If there is a rocket launcher near & the enemy is just in front, grab it & kill shooting coming near
